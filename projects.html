                This is my first big Java project. 
                It is a GUI program with Java and Swing framework that
                 emulates the stock market and allows users to buy or 
                 sell ~1000 stocks of their choice. It uses a SQL database for login and user authentification purposes as well 
                as keeping track of user's balances and stock inventory.
                The app support operations such as buying/selling stocks, 
                depositing and retracting funds(not real funds).
                The app allow user to research stocks and provide
                 the current price as well as a graph(using the JfreeChart library)
                  made of the historical data from up to 1Year. 
                  The app use the Jsoup library to parse through the 
                  HTML link from the google finance website. To do this
                   I built a Web-Scrapper and used the JSoup library to
                    automatically fetch and assemble real time data of 
                    the stock prices from the Google Finance website every 
                    5 seconds
