    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            My name is Pascal Edouard. I am a recent graduate from the University of 
            Notre Dame. I majored in Mathematics with a minor in Actuarial Sciences.
             After taking multiple classes that involved coding,  I realized that I
              wanted to become a Software Engineer. </p>
<p>
 To this end, I dedicated myself to learning new programming
  languages (Java ,Python,C++) as well as Data Structures and Algorithms.
   I completed a project that consisted of making a Stock Trading App clone. 
   And it involved many things that interest me, such as trading, finances, and 
   coding. I am looking for entry level jobs or internships as a SWE.
